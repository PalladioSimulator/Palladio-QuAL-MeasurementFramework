/**
 * This package provides the core concept of the Measurement Framework: measurements. Such measurements are
 * taken in a list of measures, a metric description, and at a concrete measuring point. We distinguish
 * between (1) basic measurements, i.e., measurements with only one measure and (2) tuple measurements, i.e.,
 * measurements with a list of measures.
