/**
 * Measure providers offer access to an ordered list of measure objects as defined by the JScience
 * Framework. Measurements are the typical entities that want to provide such measures. Therefore,
 * they make use of the classes provided within this package, e.g., by implementing the
 * @see{IMeasureProvider} interface. Other classes are convenience classes that allow for an
 * easy implementation of that interface.
